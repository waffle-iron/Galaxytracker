# Galaxytracker
Issue tracker for my Eve Online wormhole mapper found here: http://partymapper.azurewebsites.net/ (Currently in testing)

Since the project source code is technically close source, for now anyway, I will be using this repo to track all of my open issues. As well as my current progress on items I am working on.

Feel free to open issues for discussions and enhancements as well!
